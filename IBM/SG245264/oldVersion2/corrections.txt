Chapter/	Problem/Description
Page

/XX	Incorrect ftp address (page viii in Prentice Hall version of book)
	The ftp address should be: ftp://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks/SG245264. Anywhere
	in the book you see an ftp.almaden.ibm.com address, substitute the above and
	make sure you use lower case letters. 

/xxi	spelling correction (redbook only)
	exmaples should be examples

1/6	Incorrect figure reference
	The reference to Figure 3 on this page actually refers to Figure 2.

1/9  	To create the sample applet, click Next on the first page, and mark the checkbox
	Write example on the 4th page. Click Finish after that to generate the sample code.

1/20	Code in screen capture doesn't match code in text
	System.out.println("Loop number:' should read: 'System.out.println("Loop:'  
	The string "number" should be removed, as it is not present in the code 
	displayed in Figure 13, or the output in Figure 14.

3/73 	BigDecimal property fails in VisualAge for Java Version 3.
	This is a known problem in Version 3, creation of a BigDecimal property fails.
	Circumvention: Create the property as java.math.BigInteger, then fix the code:
	- private java.math.BigDecimal fieldBalance = new java.math.BigDecimal(0);
	- public java.math.BigDecimal getBalance() { ... }
	- public void setBalance(java.math.BigDecimal balance) {
		java.math.BigDecimal oldValue = fieldBalance; 
		...

3/75,80	Confusing screen captures
	The screen captures on page 75 shows the accountType property 
	feature while the screen capture on page 80 shows the getAccountType()
	method feature as well. On page 74, step h says: Select accountType from 
	the list. This will only create the accountType property. The code will still 
	work exactly the same way however, because a readable property implies
	the getter method.

3/80	Incorrect toString code
	The toString method returns the bank account information as well as the 
	transactions on the account. Although this works well for testing in this section,
	it does not work in Chapter 6 when the toString method is used to create list
	entries for accounts. Enter the toString method as follows:
	public String toString() {
		return getAccountType() + ": " + getAccountId() + " Balance: " + getBalance();
	}
	The results shown on page 96,97 will not show the transactions once you have made
	this change.

4/130	Incorrect Figure
	Figure 74 shows the BookmarkListController in the itso.bookmark package.
	It is actually in the itso.bookmark.applet package.

6/220	PIN echoed to the screen
	For a more realistic ATM you should make the PIN text field a JPasswordField
	once you have tested the application. That way the PIN is not echoed to the 
	screen.

6/231	Incorrect list elements
	Add getListModel().clear(); before the for loop in the fillList method of the
	AtmAccountPanel bean.

6/238	Incorrect connection references 
	In Table 14:
		The Comments column in the connection 14 row should say:
			Parameter is connection 15.
		The Connection from column in the connection 15 row should say:
			Connection 14 parameter.
		The Connection from column in connections 16 and 17 rows should say:
			connection 14 normal result.

6/241	Clicking Previous and then selecting the same account in AtmAccountPanel.
	If you click the Previous button in the AtmTransactionPanel and then
	select the same account in the AtmAccountPanel and click Next, the 
	transactions for the account are not listed. On page 241, use the following
	instructions in place of paragraph 1:
	Create an event to code connection from componentShown on AtmTransactionPanel
	to the updateTransactions method.

 7/222,225 Incorrect table and figure mapping
	Connection 8 shown in the Figure 133 is actually connection 9 in Table 10
	and vice-versa.
	
7/275	Incorrect creation of SQL specification.
	In order for the Delete function to work correctly the MYTITLE
	parameter must be defined in the SQL specification. Instead of 
	entering the SQL statement directly in the SQL editor use the
	SQL Assist to generate the query. The SQL Assist settings are as follows:
	Table: USERID.BOOKMARKS (where USERID is the ID you are using in this chapter).
	Condition 1: Title is exaclty equal to :MYTITLE 
	Columns: Title and URL
	The final SQL statement will look the same as the original in the book, but
	VisualAge will generate the correct SQL specification for you.

7/268	Incorrect package name
	In Step 2 of "Setting the Class Path", the package name should be 
	itso.bookmark.databeans.BookmarkListView, not itso.bookmark.BookmarkListView.

9/316	Incorrect example code
	In the changeLanguage and init methods there is an extra period after US in both methods in
	the following lines:
	updateGui(java.util.Locale.U.S.); in changeLanguage
	getLanguageChoice().addItem(java.util.Locale.U.S..getDisplayLanguage()); in init
	Remove the extra period when you create this code.

10/377,378 Incorrect method call to test versions.
	If you are using VisualAge for Java Enterprise Edition you must test
	for not equal to isEdition() instead of equal to isVersion() for the
	projects, packages and types in makeVersion. Ths is because there are
	also scratch editions in the Enterprise Edition. You must also call relase()
	after createVersion() for the types and packages.

App B,385	Incorrect page numbering. Appendix B repeats pages 385 and 386.
